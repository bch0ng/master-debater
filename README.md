# Master Debater
By Boya Cao, Brandon Chong, Yvonne Liu, Leon Tan
## Project Description 
We plan to build an online debating web application to let students, developers, and people of all software backgrounds to debate with one another on the internet. A debate will be generated by the server every hour and debates will last for a total of an hour. In the debate room, there will be debaters and an audience; debaters will debate in a free-for-all format and the audience will be able to read the discussions.

Our target audiences including people of any software background and experience that wish to develop and test their knowledge across a wide span of topics, in debate form. For this audience, Master debater will be a great way to meet more people, both like-minded and opposite-minded, on the internet. By debating, we hope to help current and future software developers to expand their thinking horizon, so that they can be more informed in their development decisions.

Additionally, arguing with people in real life can be difficult because it is often difficult confronting others about their opinions. Also, a person's reputation can be damaged or a good relationship can be ruined due to a debate. But with Master Debater users can choose to debate anonymously (hidden behind a username) that would not affect them (unless their username was identifiable). By using Master Debater, we hope that the skills of debating, questioning, and collaborative brainstorming will transfer to real life and make the users better team players and developers.

From a utilitarian perspective the joy that these people generate from each other is a moral good and enabling them to fight with each other is just. We want to make the world a better place by educating others on various different CS and programming topics.
 
## Technical Description
### Infrastructure
The system will heavily rely on Docker containers to isolate the client, server, and database. Users will only interact with the client, and the server will perform all the required actions to provide a seamless user experience for debating.
